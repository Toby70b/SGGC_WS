# SteamGroupGameChecker Web Service - A Tool to find out common steam games between users

â›” PLEASE NOTE: This should be obvious but none of the code here should be considered "production ready" by a business standard.

:wave:: a working version of this can be found hosted on AWS <a href="https://www.steamgroupgamechecker.co.uk/">here</a>. For maximum cost-effectiveness (and because I'm cheap :smile:) the API is running on Spot EC2 instances, so it could go down if the AZ its running on is in particular demand

## Rationale for development

I belong to a group of 5-6 20 something friends whose primary hobby is gaming, as such we all have steam accounts with each of us owning at least 200 games. We all prefer to play games together, we dont mind replaying games, including older games, if it means we can play together. We would occasionally ask what games we have in common, however since steam only allows users to compare their lists with one other user at a time this task was very tedious. I wanted more excuses to practice on REST API's so I researched Steam's API and once I discovered it was feasible to make a tool that could compare multiple users lists for common games I decided to make this tool.

## REST API

The REST API is a spring boot project (created using spring initializr) run using a Tomcat server. The API is exposed (by default) on port 8080, it currently only has two endpoints. The primary endpoint is a POST endpoint which takes a json object consisting of an array of ids which correspond to Steam User Id's (these are publicly available, either by using the Steam client or through the Steam API) it also takes a boolean parameter to flag whether only multiplayer games should be returned in the result set

An example of the body of the post request is:
```
{
	"steamIds" : [76561198045206229,76561198014258751,76561198171740181,76561198069846749],
	"multiplayerOnly": true
}
```

Upon success the API will return a json object consisting of game objects that contain the game's Application Id on the Steam db as well as the game's name . The returned games are multiplyer games the users entered in the input have in common.

An example of the output of ther API is:
```
[
    {
       "appid": 730,
       "name": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"
    },
    {
        "appid": 218230,
        "name": "PlanetSide 2"
    }
]
```

There is also a swagger endpoint on the root of port 8080 if you want to view documentation in swagger format

## UI

## Docker

The API has a docker images ready for containerization

## Things to improve

- [ ] Creation and documentation of SGGCXXXX error codes errors returned from the API, for easier consuming
- [ ] Improve logging framework, especially with AWS
- [ ] Adding security features
- [x] integration tests
